[![Go](https://github.com/tombrereton/go-hot-reload/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tombrereton/go-hot-reload/actions/workflows/go.yml)

## Introduction

Go Hot Reload is an open-source starter template, designed to streamline the development process with hot reloading for Go, HTML and Tailwind CSS. It's a perfect starting point for server side web development, particularly for those using `htmx`.

## Features

- üîÑ **Live Reloading**: Automatic Go rebuild using [`air`](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air). Configured in `.air.toml`.
- üî• **Hot Reloading**: Dynamic HTML updates with [`reload`](https://github.com/aarol/reload). Uses `concurrently` npm package for running `air` and `npx tailwind` together. Details in `package.json`.
- üìÑ **HTML Templates**: [`chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router for serving HTML templates.
- üíÖ **Tailwind**: CSS framework for responsive, customizable UI components with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Containerized environment for easy deployment and scalability. Includes multi-stage builds for efficient image size (approximately 18 MB).
- üöÄ **HTMX**: Enhance your HTML with AJAX, WebSockets, and more using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), enabling rich interactions with minimal JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install npm Modules**: Run `npm install` to set up necessary modules.

   ```
   PORT=3000
   IS_DEVELOPMENT=true
   TEMPLATES_DIR=web/templates/
   STATIC_DIR=web/static
   ```
3. **Launch the Development Server**: Start the server using `npm run dev`.
4. **Hot Reload**: Change the tailwind classes in `templates/landing.html` to see hot reload in action.

### Running Tests

The server includes an integration test.

- Execute tests using `go test ./...`.
- Or using npm command `npm run test`

### Docker

1. **Build Image**: `npm run docker:build`
2. **Run Image**: `npm run docker:run`
